        "regarded as one of the most brilliant minds of his generation. Now "
        "with a net worth of $66 billion, the young CEO is credited with "
        "creating a social network that has more monthly active users than any "
        "single country in the world has people, and his majority voting rights "
        "give him complete control of the company â€” which also means he's often "
        "the focal point of any backlash or scandal. And for the last year, "
        "Facebook has faced scandal after scandal. It's been called out on "
        "multiple occasions for the way it handles user data, to the point where "
        "it's led many to debate the pros and cons of free networks like "
        "Facebook that rely on advertisers for revenue. In April, Zuckerberg "
        "was summoned to give 10 hours of testimony to Congress as lawmakers "
        "sought answers about Facebook's role in various events like the 2016 "
        "election and the Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal. In the "
        "midst of the scandals, Zuckerberg has defended Facebook and reiterated "
        "the company's stated mission to connect the world with projects like "
        "bringing internet access to areas without less connectivity through his "
        "charity work, he's poured millions into education efforts and billions "
        "into initiatives for curing the world's diseases. But the recent "
        "revelations have put a spotlight on Zuckerberg and his company like "
        "never before. Here's a look at the timeline of Zuckerberg's career, "
        "from his humble beginnings in a New York suburb to his role as one of "
